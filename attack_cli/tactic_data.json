The ability to remotely execute scripts or code can be a feature of adversary remote access tools, but adversaries may also reduce their tool footprint on the network by using legitimate credentials alongside inherent network and operating system functionality to remotely connect to systems.Movement across a network from one system to another may be necessary to achieve an adversary's goals. Thus lateral movement, and the techniques that lateral movement relies on, are often very important to an adversary's set of capabilities and part of a broader set of information and access dependencies that the adversary takes advantage of within a network. To understand intrinsic security dependencies, it is important to know the relationships between accounts and access privileges across all systems on a network.
